# Tux4Kids - Open source education software for children

## About Tux4Kids

Tux4Kids is an international group of volunteers developing high-quality software for kids, with the goal of combining fun and learning into an irresistable package.

Our software is free: you can download it for use at home or onto hundreds of computers in a school. We support all major platforms, including Windows, Macintosh, and Linux/Unix. Our programs are used by people around the globe, and they have been translated into dozens of different languages. As open-source software, these programs can be freely extended or customized, and they are supported by active communities of volunteer developers.

Whether you're a parent, a teacher, or a kid, give Tux4Kids software a try!

## Main Projects

### Tux Paint
[Tux Paint](http://www.tuxpaint.org/) is a drawing program for children as young as 3 years old, containing Tux the Linux penguin, many goofy sound effects, and a large assortment of prepackaged imagery and special effect tools.

### Tux, of Math Command
[Tux, of Math Command](tuxmath.md) lets kids hone their arithmetic skills while they defend penguins from incoming comets, or offers them a chance to explore the asteroid belt with only their factoring abilities to bring them through safely!

### Tux Typing
In [Tux Typing](tuxtyping.md), Tux the penguin is hungry, and loves to eat fish. But Tux can only catch the fish if you type the right letters in time! Can you help Tux?

### Other projects
There are also a number of in-progress projects that can be found on our [GitHub project page](https://github.com/tux4kids/).
