# Tux, of Math Command

## About

"Tux, of Math Command" ("TuxMath", for short) lets kids hone their arithmetic skills while they defend penguins from incoming comets, or offers them a chance to explore the asteroid belt with only their factoring abilities to bring them through safely! 

In "Tux, of Math Command," you play the part of Commander Tux, as he defends his friends from an attack of math equations. Comets are crashing towards the friendly penguins in their igloos, and you must destroy the comets by solving their equations.

As of version 1.7.0, TuxMath also includes a completely new game activity, "Factoroids", which gives practice in factoring numbers and simplifying fractions, as well as zapping rocks floating through space.
